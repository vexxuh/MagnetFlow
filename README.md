# MagnetFlow
## Streamline Your Downloads with MagnetFlow!

### Summary
Overview: MagnetFlow is a cross-platform torrenting infrastructure designed to streamline the downloading of torrent files via magnet links. Available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, the application aims to provide users with a seamless experience for managing their downloads while ensuring data privacy.

Core Features:

    Magnet Link Integration: Automatically handles magnet links from web browsers, allowing users to initiate downloads with a single click.
    Dual Interface:
        Download Progress Page: Displays real-time status updates on ongoing downloads, complete with progress bars and notifications.
        File Management Page: Enables users to organize their downloaded filesâ€”offering options to delete, move, or update directories with ease.

Backend Functionality:

    The application leverages rqbit, a torrent downloader, running on a secure server hosted in a Docker container. This architecture offloads the downloading process from the client machine to a dedicated server.
    To enhance user privacy, all download traffic is routed through Gluetun, masking the server's IP address and ensuring anonymity.

User Experience: MagnetFlow prioritizes a clean, intuitive interface that simplifies the torrenting process for both novice and experienced users. The combination of powerful backend processing and user-friendly design makes it a versatile tool for managing torrent downloads securely and efficiently.

Goals:

    To provide a fast, reliable, and privacy-focused solution for torrent downloading.
    To empower users with easy management of their downloaded files and an organized workflow.

MagnetFlow stands out as a comprehensive system for anyone looking to enhance their torrent downloading experience for their homelab/homeserver while maintaining privacy and control over their files with a few simple clicks!
